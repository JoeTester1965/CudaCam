Update code to use non deprecated API.

One instance of Cudacamz per camera - mitigate blocking fx.

Measure elapsed time in main processing loop so can sleep at end of loop to allow a AI_PROCESSING_FPS value in config file.

Allow separate streams for AI and Motion detect as most cameras have dual ports. e.g. 1080p and 640x400.

Bypass GPU processing as necessary for scale factor 1.0. 

Motion mask for cameras - base on startup image - paint black and white.

ping proper IP when camera goes down if remapped, not 127.0.0.1

email as a separate thread and with a messages per hour limit per camera, default 10!
